	<h1>More About Me</h1>
	<p>Im a pretty average guy, pretty average height, someone who wouldn't stand out in the slightest. Despite that, I like to think I have slightly above average athletisim. I used to train in competitive swimming, and as a superhero I have to run around a lot during my battles with evil. I can't really say I have any sort of talent, unlike my brother whos an accomplished artist. I'm a pretty average guy all around, but in a way that makes it my special talent! </p>
