	<h1>Where I Live</h1>
	<p>Within our planet of Htrae I live in the city of Nattahnam, and within the city of Nattahman I live in the quiet little suburban neighborhood of Hedwigton. Its a ways from the main city, about an hour commute, but its quiet and relaxing, and I wouldn't live anywhere else in the city. I live with my older brother Vincent, in modest two story home, along with our pet Dog Otter, Alisha. We live right on the edge of a forest, so every morning I'll wake up to the sound of Rat Owls croaking by my window, and to the sound of my Dog Otter meowing for attention.</p>
